This series of workshops will introduce tools and practices for conducting reproducible research with quantitative data. Topics covered include principles of reproducible workflows, using Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration, and best practices for project management. Researchers at any level are welcome; no programming experience is needed but basic familarity with a coding environment (R, Pyton, Matlab) will be helpful. The workshops are presented in sequence but can be attended independently.

### Workshop 1: Reproducible Research Workflows
Reproducibility is central to scientific inquiry. In this workshop, participants will discuss the principles underlying reproducible research (e.g., FAIR data, open science) and consider how to build a reproducible research workflow. Exercises will focus on best practices that facilitate reproducibility and collaboration, such as file and project organization. This is a non-technical workshop (although computational tools will be discussed).

### Workshop 2: Version Control with Git
Data analysis can produce a lot of files – raw data, processed data, scripts, model outputs, and more! Version control keeps these files organized and tracks changes over time, making it easier for you to reproduce your analyses and to step backward/’undo’ changes as needed during the analysis process. In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of using git for version control (e.g. initializing and committing to local repositories). We will use both the command line and a Git client to practice basic Git commands and workflow

### Workshop 3: Collaboration with GitHub
While version control with Git enhances reproducibility, GitHub takes it to the next level by facilitating collaboration. In this workshop, participants will practice collaborating on GitHub, including pushing and pulling changes to a shared repository. We will also explore some of GitHub’s additional functionality (e.g. using Issues) that can support scientific teams. 

### Workshop 4: Reproducible reports with RMarkdown
RMarkdown is a useful extension of the Markdown language that combines text and executable code in one document (with support for programming languages besides R). This workshop will introduce RMarkdown and demonstrate ways to incorporate RMarkdown files into a reproducible workflow, including through collaboration on GitHub. Familiarity with R, RStudio, and GitHub, or participation in earlier workshops, is recommended; the first 20 min of the workshop will include a rapid overview of RStudio and the RStudio interface with Git/GitHub.

### Workshop 5: Metadata and documentation

### Workshop 6: Working with data repositories
